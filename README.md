# perplexity_code_review
A full-stack AI-powered code review platform built for the Perplexity Hackathon. It uses the Sonar model from Perplexity's API to analyze source code and provide intelligent feedback for code quality, third-party dependencies, and license checks.

## Important 
Substitute the API key in the file backend_config.py and the frontend reactjs renderer server in frontend_config.py
If you only want to use SOnar API then you dont need OpenAI Key.
Also if you are not using local hosted model like llama2 etc from ollama then dont need a ollama endpoint,
just the perplexity API key is enough.
